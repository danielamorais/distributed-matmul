Search Paths

A single Dana project directory is often sufficient, together with Dana's standard library, to describe all of the functionality that you need for a given project. Sometimes, however, we might like to access the code from another project.

Dana supports inter-project code sharing using search paths.

By default, when you compile or run a program, the compiler and runtime have two search paths for source files or compiled components: the current directory, and the Dana standard library. The current directory is searched first, then the standard library.

You can specify additional search paths using the -sp parameter for either the compiler or the runtime. Search paths are specified using a semicolon-separated list, for example:

dnc MyProgram.dn -sp "folderA;folderB"

In this case, the compiler will have four search paths, in this order:

    the current directory
    the directory folderA
    the directory folderB
    the standard library

The same logic applies to the Dana runtime, when searching for components.

You can also use the environment variable DANA_SP to specify system-wide search paths for all uses of the compiler or runtime. If DANA_SP is specified, the search order becomes:

    the current directory
    the paths on DANA_SP
    the paths on -sp (if any)
    the standard library

Finally, you can use the command-line option -spo to specify search paths and ignore anything on DANA_SP.
