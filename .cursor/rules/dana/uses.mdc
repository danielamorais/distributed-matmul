Using data types defined in other source files

When a component declares provided or required interfaces, the compiler will automatically include all types defined in the corresponding source files of those interfaces, for use locally.

Sometimes it's also necessary to include types defined in source files that are neither provided or required interfaces.

This is done with the uses notation, expressed before the start of the component definition. For example:

uses time.DataTime

component provides App {
	
	}

The same search procedure is used to locate the corresponding source file as is used in searching for provided and required interface source files.
