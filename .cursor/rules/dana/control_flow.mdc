Dana supports if statements, while loops and for loops to control conditional or iterative logic.

If statements work exactly as in C or Java and can use the && and || operators to indicate logical and/or. You can also use else if and else blocks as in these languages.

if (a)
    {
    out.println("a is true!")
    }

While loops allow you to loop through a section of logic many times based on some boolean condition, specified at the top of the loop.

while (a)
    {
    out.println("a is true!")
    }

In the above example, the loop body will be executed iteratively while "a" evaluates to true.

For loops allow you to specify an initial variable status, a condition, and a modification to that variable each time around the loop:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
    out.println("i is $(iu.intToString(i))")
    }

This is often used as a short hand to iterate over the loop logic a fixed number of times.

Finally, the break statement can be used inside any kind of loop construct to break out of the loop when some other condition is encountered, for example:

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
    out.println("i is $(iu.intToString(i))")
    
    if (programExiting)
        break
    }
